    "body" : "Phil Libin discusses the impact of technology—from Microsoft Word to wearables—on our collaboration and productivity. Download this podcast NICOLE TORRES: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Nicole Torres. I’m joined on the phone today by Phil Libin, the CEO of Evernote. Phil, thanks for joining us. PHIL LIBIN: Thank you, really nice to be with you. NICOLE TORRES: So there are so many tools and apps out there that shape how we collaborate and stay productive, and Evernote is one of those tools. There are now more than 100 million users around the world using your app. But can you first tell our listeners more about what Evernote is? PHIL LIBIN: Well we are a workspace. We are basically an integrated way where you can do all of your writing and communicating about the stuff that you’re working on. NICOLE TORRES: And it seems like Evernote has picked up where earlier software like Microsoft Office and AOL Instant Messenger left off. How have you guys built on those tools? PHIL LIBIN: Well I think a lot of the old metaphors for what it means to be productive are really shaped by this very physical world ideas. You know, probably the start of our industry of productivity using computers maybe about 30 years ago, which is when Microsoft Office was created. And the designers of the products back then we’re faced with this really big task of how do you explain what technology can do, what computers can do to people that had no idea. And so very naturally they reached for these physical, real world metaphors like files, and folders, and desktops, slides, telephones. And we basically got experiences there were rooted in the physical world. And we’ve now had an entire generation of people who don’t need those physical crutches and the metaphors are actually just starting to get in the way. So what we’re trying to do is to come up with new metaphors, new paradigms for what does it actually mean to be productive, that aren’t rooted in these cognitively skeuomorphic ideas of the past. NICOLE TORRES: And so what are some examples of these old metaphors that some of these technologies were rooted in and what are the newer ones that you’re focused on? PHIL LIBIN: Well, I think a really clear example is, what’s actually happening a lot right now, is the success of things like Dropbox and Slack are, I think, the last big ideas in the old metaphors. So I think the way a lot of people think about working today is you write in Microsoft Office, and you store it in Dropbox, and then you talk about it in Slack. In Slack if you’re you know, pretty modern, or in email if you’re not. And that idea works OK on desktops. It works OK if you can you know, Alt tab over to different programs and cut and paste and do things like that. But our whole hypothesis is that going forward you need an integrated experience. You need your writing, and your communicating, and collaborating as really part of the same set of operations. And if it’s designed by a unified team with a unified set of goals, you just get a much more powerful experience. And especially one that’s going to work well with mobile and with wearables, which I think are increasingly important to the way that we’re going to be productive. NICOLE TORRES: Right and so I do want to ask you about wearables, but before I get to that question I want to move back to what you were saying about integration. Because one thing I’ve noticed is how we’re all using our Facebook, Twitter, Google logins to sign into our other apps and accounts. PHIL LIBIN: Mm hm. NICOLE TORRES: And then you mentioned Slack, and Slack syncs to Google Docs or to Trello. So how important is integration when it comes to creating new tools, and if people expect every service to just work with every other service, doesn’t that present certain challenges for your business? PHIL LIBIN: Yeah. I think it’s important in the early stages, it’s important for early adopters. You know, it’s important for nerds like me, we just want to tie together all of our stuff and we’re going to you know, twiddle with things a lot. But I don’t think it’s important for the mainstream user. I think all of these things go through a period where initially it’s about wiring together the best possible experiences. NICOLE TORRES: Right. PHIL LIBIN: And people that are on the cutting edge, the early adopters do that for everybody else, and then at some point a really elegant and smooth interface. They just kind of figure it out and then the workflow standardize, and then things go to the best overall or integrated experience. And you’ve kind of seen this over and over again for decades where at one point there was everyone kind of assemble their favorite word processor, and their favorite database, and their favorite spreadsheet, and their favorite email client, and their favorite presentation software. And back when that was in the early adopter stage there was tons of this software available that did all this. You had Harvard Graphics, and Quattro and Word Perfect. And then Microsoft came along when the market started to go mainstream and said no, it’s actually just Office. So I think you’re seeing the same kind of thing. There’s a proliferation of tools right now and there’s early adopter geeks like me who love them, and who love playing around with them. But ultimately there’s going to be a small number of dominant players that just make the best mainstream experiences. NICOLE TORRES: OK. So there’s this gap, right, between the early adopters and then the people like the mainstream who tend to use whatever everyone else is using. And so since Evernote has launched, I’m sure you’ve seen your users and their behaviors have evolved. So has that gap been bridged a little bit or are there other big things you’ve seen that have changed? PHIL LIBIN: Well I think there’s a bunch of interesting things that are happening. One is that I think you still have early adopters. NICOLE TORRES: Mm hm. PHIL LIBIN: But I think the number of early adopters in the world has mushroomed. It has just magnified tremendously, it’s kind of exploded. Because the barrier for being an early adopter is so much lower than it used to be. You know, it used to be if you were an early adopter you really had to be ready to put up with a good amount of pain and suffering. And getting things set up, and spending a lot of money on them, and going out a way to find a different product. And that pain is much less. So basically everyone– almost everyone– could be an early adopter in the field that they love, in the field that they’re passionate about. So you know if you’re super passionate about bird watching, you’re going to be an early adopter of bird watching apps and technologies, even if you are completely on the mainstream curve for something else. So even if you say that Evernote users today– and we have as you said, more than a hundred million– a lot of them may still be early adopters. It’s just that there are probably tens of millions of early adopters of various types in the world right now. But that shouldn’t confuse you into thinking that there isn’t a mainstream. There is a mainstream. Because if the early adopter market is probably millions of people, the mainstream is a billion, people two billion people. NICOLE TORRES: Right. PHIL LIBIN: And it is going to be pretty different once we actually start reaching a billion people, or two billion people. And I think where we are as a company is really in that transition. We’re going from a very large early adopter install phase and really starting to see the beginnings of the mainstream usage. NICOLE TORRES: And how is that changing what you’re focusing on? PHIL LIBIN: Well, we’re focusing on the things that mainstream users expect, which is quality and kind of a continuity of experience. And those are hard. It turns out it’s much more work to polish an existing product and just to make it incrementally better than is to make something totally new and totally shiny and totally flashy. So I think the company’s growing up. It really feels like Evernote is, we’re past the stage of being a precocious toddler and we’re in the kind of– [LAUGHTER] PHIL LIBIN: –awkward adolescent years. We’re actually now having to think about how other people interact with us and trying to care about the needs of users, partners and investors and everything else, and not so much be all about us. So it’s definitely a pretty profound shift on how we think about everything. NICOLE TORRES: Yeah. So you guys just launched Evernote for Apple Watch. And everyone is saying that wearables is the next big frontier. PHIL LIBIN: Mm hm. NICOLE TORRES: Can you tell me more about how you’re thinking about wearables, why we’re moving in this direction and what does it even mean for how we’re going to work? PHIL LIBIN: So I think wearables are a little bit of a red herring, actually. I think a lot of people are thinking about the wrong thing here. It isn’t so much that the future is about things that you wear on your body. It isn’t so much that the future is about watches or smart glasses. What’s really happening is the future is much more about product experiences that are about the end user, that are about the person. It’s a very human centered approach instead of a device centered approach. What wearables will really do is they’ll make the devices fade into the background. NICOLE TORRES: Hm. PHIL LIBIN: So instead of building an app for the Apple Watch, you don’t really build an app for the Apple Watch. You build an app for the person who has an Apple Watch. And that may be sound like a strange distinction, but it’s actually pretty profound distinction. Everyone who has an Apple Watch also has an iPhone. So you’re not actually building a watch app, you’re building an app that is at the same time watch and phone. And soon you’ll be watch and phone and desktop and TV and car and refrigerator and glasses and all these other things. NICOLE TORRES: Right. PHIL LIBIN: You’re going to feel like you are surrounded by a digital force field of intelligence, where wherever you happen to look, there will be something there. And it’ll become much less about any particular device. And so I think the Apple Watch is going to be really the device that makes this idea mainstream. NICOLE TORRES: Hm. PHIL LIBIN: But it isn’t about the particular device. It’s about, now it has to be about the person. NICOLE TORRES: Right, more about the human experience. PHIL LIBIN: The human experience across multiple devices. NICOLE TORRES: Ah. PHIL LIBIN: Which is really different. Like when we were building an app for the iPhone originally, were very much building the app for the iPhone. But when you’re building an app for the watch you’re actually not building it for the watch, you’re really building it for the person and for multiple devices. And that’s a really, really profound shift that even we don’t fully understand. NICOLE TORRES: Right. PHIL LIBIN: We’re probably at the forefront of it. But it’s going to be, this is going to be a super exciting cataclysm in the design community over the next couple of years as this really sinks in. NICOLE TORRES: So what were some specific changes you had to consider when designing for the Apple Watch experience? PHIL LIBIN: Well, there’s really a bunch of changes. There’s some very obvious ones which is, you know people think that the main difference is like the screen is smaller. NICOLE TORRES: Mm hm. PHIL LIBIN: And actually it has very little to do the size of the screen. What really matters is the session length. So when you’re designing for a computer, when you’re designing for like a desktop computer or a laptop, the average session length on those is like a couple of hours. When you’re sitting at your desktop computer using Microsoft Word, you’re on it for a couple of hours at a time. Or if you’re sitting on your Mac using Evernote, you’re on it for on average, I think it’s like 40 minutes at a time. So when you’ve got 40 minutes or an hour or two hours, you can let the user think about things like files, and folders, and organization, structures, and apps. But then when you go to a phone, your session length drops from 40 minutes or an hour to five minutes. Like average session on the phone is about five minutes. NICOLE TORRES: Uh huh. PHIL LIBIN: But instead of doing it once a day, you’re doing it like 20 times a day. And so how do you make somebody productive five minutes at a time 20 times a day? Well one thing is you can no longer worry about files. You can no longer worry about concepts that you just don’t have time in five minutes to worry about. Things have to become much more predictive. The system has to anticipate what you want to do. Now when you go from the phone to the watch, the session length drops from five minutes to five seconds. NICOLE TORRES: Wow. PHIL LIBIN: But it goes from 20 times a day to like 200 times a day. So now you say, OK how do you make someone productive five seconds at a time, 200 times a day. Or if you’re making a video game, how do I keep you entertained five seconds at a time. Like that’s really different. NICOLE TORRES: Is that even possible? PHIL LIBIN: No, it’s totally possible. It’s just hard. You know, if I’m a video game maker, and I’m making you know, Halo on the Xbox, my challenge is how do I keep you entertained for hours at a time when you’re sitting in front of a big monitor. NICOLE TORRES: Right. PHIL LIBIN: Making that transition to five seconds at a time is really pretty profound. But the major difference is you’re no longer working in a world where someone is going to do everything on their particular device. When you’re designing for a desktop computer, like when we were making Evernote for the Mac, we assume that every feature has to be on that version. But when you’re making something for the watch, you’re not trying to cram every feature in there, because anything that takes more than five seconds you should just pull out your phone and do it. Because anyone with a watch also has the phone. NICOLE TORRES: Right. PHIL LIBIN: So you get into this much, I think, more elegant and human centric design approach where you say OK, what’s best done five seconds at a time? Do it on your watch. What’s best done five minutes at a time? Do that on your phone. What’s best done an hour at a time? Do that on your computer. And nothing’s really been designed this way before. We’re really at the birth of this kind of design movement. NICOLE TORRES: Wow. So I’m going to back up a little bit from some of this because I’m still one of those people who likes to keep work and personal separate. So I have a separate work and personal email account. But when we’re talking about making these transitions between devices pretty seamless and it’s all about an experience– PHIL LIBIN: Mm hm. NICOLE TORRES: –do think that is blurring the line between work and life a little too much? PHIL LIBIN: You know, I think it’s not so much that I think most people want to keep work and personal separate. NICOLE TORRES: Uh huh. PHIL LIBIN: Because after all, they’re not separate in your head. In your brain, as a knowledge worker, they’re very much intermingled. You are stressing out about all of them all the time, you’re thinking about all of them all the time. You get pleasure and satisfaction about being productive professionally and personally kind of all the time. So in your head they’re not separate, they’re in the same brain. You’re the same person, and they’re both equally important to you. What you really want is to, when people say they want to keep things separate, what they really mean is that they don’t want there to be any kind of like accidental disclosure. They don’t want things to leak from one to the other. They don’t want to accidentally have their coworker see private information. NICOLE TORRES: Right. PHIL LIBIN: Or vice versa. And so that’s really about just good design. It’s about making sure that there’s minimizes confusion, gives people a sense that they’re in control. It comes down to this feeling that your control where things go, not that you may make a mistake and put something the wrong place or disclose something. That’s a really hard design challenge. NICOLE TORRES: Mm hm. PHIL LIBIN: That’s much harder than punting the problem to the user and being like, well it’s your responsibility, Mr. User, to figure out how to keep things separate. To say OK, it’s our responsibility to have a design that lets you feel like your in control is harder, but ultimately that’s what it has to be. And we don’t do that perfectly. By all accounts, there’s all sorts of things that could be much crisper and that could make that desire to be in control of your personal life and your work life, to have that desire more fulfilled. But I think every day we’re making progress in that. And I think your question is kind of exactly right. What wearables will really do, it’s not so much that they blur that line, is that they make that good design ever more important. Because you won’t be able to really rely on just separation. You’re not going to have a work watch and a personal watch on two different hands. NICOLE TORRES: Yeah. PHIL LIBIN: It’s just going to force design to get better, and that’s exciting even though it’s difficult. NICOLE TORRES: So another one of the big challenges with creating digital products is that people expect them to be free. And you touched on this, you’re selling your users a great product that they like, that’s how you make money. So you have a freemium model. PHIL LIBIN: Yep. NICOLE TORRES: You have the basic services free, then there’s an upgraded subscription service, and then the more premium one for businesses. I’m just curious to know what you’re discovering about how well this is working? PHIL LIBIN: It’s working well. And I don’t think people expect that digital products to be free. In fact I think wearables are gonna really put the light on that– NICOLE TORRES: Uh huh. PHIL LIBIN: –in the next couple of years. People expect digital products first and foremost to be good, to be great. And as long as having a great product doesn’t conflict with being free, then you know, people will take the free product. But in the past what that’s meant is you can have a good product that’s ad supported. And so it’s free, because it’s ad supported. That’s broken as of now. Basically there will be no such thing as a great ad supported experience on your watch or on your smart glasses. It’s impossible. So very soon, when you have something that’s distracting you, when you have something that’s nagging at you, when you something that’s trying to get your do something that you don’t want to do because that’s the way they make money, that will no longer feel like a good product. And it’ll violate the first rule, and the first rule isn’t that people expect free, it’s that they expect great. NICOLE TORRES: Yes. PHIL LIBIN: And they’re totally willing to pay for great if that’s the way they get them. So I actually think the Evernote model of direct only revenue just gets easier and easier. I think we’re on the right side of history on this one. NICOLE TORRES: Yeah, that’s really, really interesting OK, so the last time we talked to you started explaining how so much of the functionality in Microsoft Word is centered around printing things out. PHIL LIBIN: Mm hm. NICOLE TORRES: But no one prints things out anymore. But I’m just wondering, are there are other changes that have happened that technology now has to keep up with? PHIL LIBIN: Yeah. I think the whole way that we work has changed. Even if you take one step up from work and you just look at life, I think almost all of life, the big trend this that it’s becoming more snackified. Life is about doing things in shorter and shorter intervals, and smaller intervals– NICOLE TORRES: Yeah. PHIL LIBIN: –more frequently. And I think that’s just true across the board of almost everything. It’s true of how we watch video. Typically you’re getting much more of your video in bite-sized chunks much more frequently than before, where maybe you would watch a couple of shows for an hour at a time or something. Now of course, there’s also the exceptions to that. Because this freedom to kind of take the time that you’re watching things has also led to things like you know, binge watching House of Cards. NICOLE TORRES: Mm hm. PHIL LIBIN: But for the most part, even with that, even with you know, people much more frequently will spend 13 hours at a time watching something. The average amount of time is shrinking and the frequency is increasing. And this is true of entertainment, it’s true of how we communicate, it’s true of how you talk to your friends, right? NICOLE TORRES: Right. PHIL LIBIN: Like you probably are spending less time on the phone for an hour and a half once a week with your best friend. And instead, you’re probably, you know you’re probably– NICOLE TORRES: Texting. PHIL LIBIN: –texting him or her. Yeah. NICOLE TORRES: Totally, yeah. PHIL LIBIN: Yeah, so it’s all becoming snackified. And this is even true of food journalism. Even if you just look at– NICOLE TORRES: What do you mean? PHIL LIBIN: Food journalism used to be primarily about restaurants. NICOLE TORRES: Uh huh. PHIL LIBIN: And now it’s primarily about dishes. NICOLE TORRES: That’s true, that’s very true. PHIL LIBIN: And it’s totally happening with how you work as well. Like you’re not working anymore for weeks at a time on a document, where you will sit by yourself at your office desk for a week. And for several hours each day you will work on a document. And then you will take this document and you will send it, either by printing it out or by emailing it, to somebody else. And then you will wait a few days for that person to read it and write back comments to you. None of that is this how you work anymore. You’re not working for hours at a time at your desk for several days in a row, and then only communicating when you’re done. You’re working for a few minutes and then immediately communicating about what you just did, immediately getting feedback, immediately changing it. Not probably doing it from your office desk most of the time, but kind of doing it from wherever. So work is becoming snackified as well. And of course you’re not printing things out. NICOLE TORRES: Yeah. PHIL LIBIN: The whole concept has changed. And in fact, work is probably at the forefront of the snackification of human life. NICOLE TORRES: Yeah. PHIL LIBIN: And you can like, you can complain about that. There’s all sorts of obvious downsides that people can point to about how the snackification is ruining everything. But people have complained about changes for every single time there’s been a change in human life. NICOLE TORRES: Right. PHIL LIBIN: Or you can embrace it. You could say actually, it’s happening this way because this is the way that our brains naturally want to work. And it’s great, we’re going to be happier, we’re going to be more productive. And you just make products that embrace it and try to make it as good as possible. NICOLE TORRES: Yeah. So my final question is about how you guys partnered with Moleskine notebooks a couple years ago. PHIL LIBIN: Uh huh. NICOLE TORRES: You created a paper digital hybrid notebook. So as we’re moving to dictating notes to our wrists and more snackified attention spans, is there still a place for paper in the digital workplace? PHIL LIBIN: Yeah I think so. I think there’s a couple of really interesting things there. I think there’s definitely more choice of experience. And there’s more quality of experience. So people will gravitate towards high quality experiences. And if the highest quality experience for taking notes for you is to have a nice piece of paper and a nice pen and actually write things down in a notebook, which is– has the advantage of being pretty discreet, pretty silent, you could do it for a few seconds of time– you’ll do that. And technology will make that experience as powerful as typing something into a computer. So I think there’s absolutely a place for paper, when and only when that paper is a wonderful experience. NICOLE TORRES: Mm hm. PHIL LIBIN: There’s no place for paper when you’re printing things out. NICOLE TORRES: Yeah. PHIL LIBIN: Or when you’re faxing stuff, or filling out forms. NICOLE TORRES: Yes. PHIL LIBIN: If you look at enterprise software, all right. The vast majority of enterprise software, even today– and this is all going to die within a few years– but the vast majority of software today is the experience of filling out a form. If you wanted a shortcut to just know which products and companies are going to be dead within five years, it’s all the ones that are basically about making you fill out a form. [LAUGHTER] PHIL LIBIN: You won’t be filling out forms 10 years from now. You won’t do it, there will be no more such a thing as filling out a form. NICOLE TORRES: What about tax forms? PHIL LIBIN: Well, even that, well that’s probably going to be the last thing. NICOLE TORRES: Yeah. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] PHIL LIBIN: The IRS probably gonna be the last one that changes. NICOLE TORRES: Yeah. PHIL LIBIN: But even there, your tax prep software is going to just do things automatically, and ask you some questions and tie into, automatically tie into receipts and other stuff. The act of taking a piece of paper, whether it’s a physical piece of paper or a computer screen that looks like a piece of paper, that has laid out like different fields and you’re filling in those fields. That is so completely not the way the human brain wants to do anything. It’s so completely alien, it’s just a short term artifact of the limitations of technology that existed for just a few decades. And since those limitations are gone now, that entire experience is going to disappear. So the Moleskine notebook has nothing in common with an IRS form. NICOLE TORRES: Yeah. PHIL LIBIN: Just because they’re both paper and pen, they actually have nothing in common other than that. PHIL LIBIN: The experiential– NICOLE TORRES: Right. PHIL LIBIN: –attributes are totally different. The Moleskine notebook is a wonderful experience for people who like that stuff. And filling out forms is a terrible experience for everyone. So one will die and one will thrive. NICOLE TORRES: Well maybe that means they’ll just be fewer paper cuts. [LAUGHTER] PHIL LIBIN: Exactly. That too. NICOLE TORRES: So Phil, this was awesome. But that’s all the time we have today. Thank you so much for this great conversation. PHIL LIBIN: Thank you. NICOLE TORRES: That was Phil Libin, CEO of Evernote.
